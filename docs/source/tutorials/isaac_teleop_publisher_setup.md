# Isaac Teleop Setup (CloudXR / DeviceIO, in-process)

This page documents the Isaac Teleop / CloudXR bring-up for **G1 with a Thor backpack** that drives `GR00T-WholeBodyControl` directly from the headset — no separate publisher container, no host `~/.cloudxr` sharing. The CloudXR runtime is hosted **in-process** by `pico_manager_thread_server.py --input-source isaac-teleop` via the `isaacteleop[cloudxr]` Python package.

```{admonition} Scope
:class: important
This workflow is currently documented and supported only for **G1 + Thor backpack**.
```

## Prerequisites

1. **Completed the [Quick Start](../getting_started/quickstart.md)** — you can run the sim2sim loop (includes [installing the deployment](../getting_started/installation_deploy.md) and [downloading model checkpoints](../getting_started/download_models.md)).
2. **Completed the [VR Teleop Setup](../getting_started/vr_teleop_setup.md)** — `.venv_teleop` is ready and `install_pico.sh` has been run on Thor.

This page is a condensed, repo-specific version of the upstream [Isaac Teleop](https://nvidia.github.io/IsaacTeleop/) docs:

- [Quick Start](https://nvidia.github.io/IsaacTeleop/main/getting_started/quick_start.html)
- [`isaacteleop[cloudxr]` Python API](https://nvidia.github.io/IsaacTeleop/main/)

## Step 1: Prepare the Thor Host

Install the prerequisites on Thor (skip any you've already done for the rest of the deploy):

```bash
sudo apt install -y build-essential curl git-lfs

ARCH=$(uname -m)
curl -L -O "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Linux-${ARCH}.sh"
bash "Miniforge3-Linux-${ARCH}.sh" -b -p "$HOME/miniforge3"
"$HOME/miniforge3/bin/conda" init
source ~/.bashrc

git lfs install
```

For Thor performance, enable max power mode before teleoperation:

```bash
sudo nvpmodel -m 0
sudo jetson_clocks
```

Optional thermal / over-current check:

```bash
cat /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon*/oc*_event_cnt
```

## Step 2: Install `isaacteleop[cloudxr]`

`install_pico.sh` (run from the [VR Teleop Setup](../getting_started/vr_teleop_setup.md) Step 3) installs the `isaacteleop[cloudxr]` package into `.venv_teleop` from the public NVIDIA index:

```bash
# Already wired into install_pico.sh; shown here for reference
uv pip install 'isaacteleop[cloudxr]~=1.3.0' --prerelease=allow \
    --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com
```

It also seeds `~/cloudxr.env` with `NV_DEVICE_PROFILE=Quest3` (override by editing the file). `CloudXRLauncher` reads this on startup.

## Step 3: Connect the XR Client

The streamer launches the CloudXR runtime as a subprocess of the Python loop the first time you start it (Step 4). Until you connect the headset, `IsaacTeleopClient.start_streaming()` will retry quietly with `"no XR session yet"`.

- Open the [Isaac Teleop Web Client](https://nvidia.github.io/IsaacTeleop/client/) in the headset browser
- Enter the IP address of the Thor host
- Accept the self-signed certificate at `https://<thor-ip>:48322`
- Return to the client page and click **Connect**

For quick validation, the same client URL can also be opened in a desktop browser.

If you prefer to run the WebXR client from source instead of the hosted client, follow the CloudXR/WebXR build instructions linked from the [Isaac Teleop Quick Start](https://nvidia.github.io/IsaacTeleop/main/getting_started/quick_start.html).

```{important}
The streamer will fail to acquire OpenXR until the XR client is connected. Either connect the headset first, or start the streamer and watch for the `Isaac Teleop session initialized.` log line once you do.
```

## Step 4: Start the C++ Deployment

From `gear_sonic_deploy/`:

```bash
export TensorRT_ROOT=$HOME/TensorRT   # only if not already in ~/.bashrc
./docker/run-ros2-dev.sh

# inside the container (setup_env.sh is sourced automatically):
just build                            # first run only
./deploy.sh --input-type zmq_manager real
# Wait until you see "Init done"
```

## Step 5: Launch the Teleop Streamer

From the **repo root**:

```bash
source .venv_teleop/bin/activate
python gear_sonic/scripts/pico_manager_thread_server.py --manager \
    --input-source isaac-teleop

# If running offboard with a display, add visualization:
#   --vis_vr3pt --vis_smpl
```

Watch the streamer logs for `Isaac Teleop session initialized.` — that means CloudXR + DeviceIO are both up. The streamer then prints `Manager controls: A+X=toggle mode, A+B+X+Y=start/stop policy` once the headset is connected and body data starts flowing.

For controls and calibration, see [VR Whole-Body Teleop](vr_wholebody_teleop.md#pico-controls).

## Step 6: Start Camera Visualization

Stream cameras to the headset via upstream IsaacTeleop's `camera_viz.sh`. If you don't have the IsaacTeleop repo yet, clone it first:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/NVIDIA/IsaacTeleop.git
```

Then create the environment for the camera visualization streamer:

```bash
cd IsaacTeleop
examples/camera_viz/camera_viz.sh setup
source examples/camera_viz/.venv/bin/activate
cd examples/camera_viz
```
### Optional: Camera Preview in a Window
If you have video preview available such as on Thor or desktop simulation, it might be best to test your camera first with the "window" mode:
```bash
./camera_viz.sh run configs/YOUR_CAMERA.yaml --mode window
```

Choosing the correct yaml configuration camera for your setup is critical. The v4l2.yaml configuration is default but other configs are available:
```bash
# run just one of these that best matches your camera
./camera_viz.sh run configs/v4l2.yaml --mode window
./camera_viz.sh run configs/oakd.yaml --mode window
./camera_viz.sh run configs/zed.yaml --mode window
./camera_viz.sh run configs/realsense.yaml --mode window
```
If you do not see correct output for your camera, you may need to modify the closest yaml file to your setup or create your own in the configs folder. Consider the following:
- Having more than one camera connected will modify what channel the video should be served from.
- First, try the command "lsusb" to see if your camera is connected.
- Next, use "ls -1 /dev/video* to list all video device modes.
- If you are using a v4l2 setup (Video4Linux2), these cammands will help to debug what is possible:
  - To see the association of channels to cameras: "v4l2-ctl --list-devices"
  - For each node, see what it captures and in what pixel formats: "v4l2-ctl --device=/dev/video0 --list-formats"
  - To see full details on formats and available resolutions:  "v4l2-ctl --device=/dev/video0 --list-formats-ext"
Once you have this information, make sure the settings in your yaml config match.

### XR Camera Streaming Command

Once you are certain you have valid yaml configured, shut down any preview windows and run instead with "--mode xr", which will stream frames to Isaac Teleop:

```bash
./camera_viz.sh run configs/[YOUR_CAMERA].yaml --mode xr
```
This should also be consistent with the [instructions found at IsaacTeleop](https://nvidia.github.io/IsaacTeleop/main/references/camera_streaming.html).

## Troubleshooting

### `RuntimeError: Failed to get OpenXR system: -35`

In this setup, that error usually means the XR client is not connected yet. Re-check:

- The headset / web client is fully connected to `https://<thor-ip>:48322`
- The CloudXR runtime subprocess is still alive (look for the `Isaac Teleop session initialized.` log)
- `~/cloudxr.env` exists and has the right `NV_DEVICE_PROFILE` for your headset

### `gear_sonic_deploy` build error

If `just build` fails, rebuild from scratch inside the container (Step 4):

```bash
rm -rf build
just build
```

### `isaacteleop` import error

Re-run `install_pico.sh` to reinstall `isaacteleop[cloudxr]~=1.3.0` into `.venv_teleop`. If `pypi.nvidia.com` is unreachable, check your network and the `--extra-index-url` flag.

### Body data not arriving

The streamer logs `[IsaacTeleopReader] No DeviceIO data for 5.0s, flagging disconnect` if the headset stops feeding body data. Confirm:

1. The headset is still connected to CloudXR (Step 3).
2. The Pico body trackers are paired and calibrated (see [VR Teleop Setup → Motion Tracker Setup](../getting_started/vr_teleop_setup.md)).
3. The first time the schema runs, watch for `[IsaacTeleopReader] Unrecognised body_data schema: type=...` — if you see it, the upstream `FullBodyTrackerPico.get_body_pose().data` shape changed and `_body_data_to_24x7()` in `gear_sonic/utils/teleop/input_readers.py` needs an extra branch for the new layout.
